# Copywriting

**When to Use:** Write or improve marketing copy for landing pages, feature pages, pricing pages, CTAs, error messages, onboarding flows, or any user-facing text. Use when optimizing conversion, clarifying value propositions, or improving UX microcopy.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Bad Example | Good Example |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Clarity > Cleverness** | "Synergize your workflow" | "Manage documents in one place" |
| **Benefits > Features** | "AI-powered search" | "Find any clause in seconds" |
| **Specific > Vague** | "Save time" | "Cut document review from 2 hours to 10 minutes" |
| **Customer Language** | "Document intelligence platform" | "Your AI assistant for real estate paperwork" |
| **Active > Passive** | "Documents are analyzed" | "We analyze your documents" |
| **Show > Tell** | "Very fast" | "Results in under 3 seconds" |

## Before Writing - Gather Context

1. **Page Purpose**: Homepage, landing page, pricing, feature page, about?
2. **Primary Action**: What should users do? (Sign up, start trial, book demo, learn more)
3. **Audience**: Real estate agents, brokers, teams?
4. **Problem**: What pain are they trying to solve?
5. **Differentiation**: What makes Smart Agent unique vs competitors?

## Smart Agent Context
- **Product**: AI assistant for real estate professionals
- **Core Value**: Analyze documents, manage CRM, chat with AI about deals
- **Primary Users**: Real estate agents drowning in paperwork
- **Key Benefit**: Turn hours of document review into minutes
- **Differentiation**: Multi-document chat, real estate-specific AI

```

```

### Error Messages (UX Microcopy)
```

✅ "Couldn't upload document. Check your connection and try again."

❌ "Invalid input"
✅ "Email address should look like: name@example.com"

❌ "Error 500"
✅ "Something went wrong on our end. We're looking into it."
```

### Onboarding (Empty States)
```
❌ "No documents"
✅ "No documents yet. Upload your first contract to get started."

❌ "No results"
✅ "No properties match your search. Try adjusting your filters."
```

## Style Rules for Smart Agent

1. **Simple words**: Use → Utilize, Help → Facilitate, Buy → Purchase
2. **Remove filler**: "very," "really," "actually," "basically"
3. **Active voice**: "We analyze" not "Documents are analyzed"
4. **No exclamation points** (feels pushy in B2B SaaS)
5. **Honest claims**: Never fabricate statistics or testimonials
6. **Avoid buzzwords**: "Streamline," "Optimize," "Revolutionary," "Game-changing"

## Content Checklist

Before publishing copy:
- [ ] Jargon-free (understandable to non-technical agents)
- [ ] One idea per section
- [ ] Benefits clearly stated (not just features)
- [ ] Specific numbers where possible ("2 hours to 10 minutes" not "faster")
- [ ] Customer language (not company jargon)
- [ ] Direct CTAs (what happens when they click)
- [ ] No exclamation points
- [ ] Active voice throughout
- [ ] Mobile-friendly (short sentences, scannable)

## Quick Copy Audit
1. Read aloud - Does it sound natural?
2. So what test - After each claim, ask "So what?" Can you answer?
3. Clarity test - Would your grandma understand it?
4. Benefit test - Does it answer "What's in it for me?"

**Note:** This skill provides conversion copywriting techniques for marketing pages and UX microcopy. Use for **landing pages, feature descriptions, CTAs, error messages, onboarding flows, and empty states**. Apply principles to improve clarity, conversion, and user experience throughout Smart Agent's interface.
