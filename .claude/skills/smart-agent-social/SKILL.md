### Tips & Education

**Twitter:**

3 questions Smart Agent users ask most:

1. "What's the closing date?"
2. "Are there any contingencies?"
3. "What's the earnest money amount?"

AI + real estate documents = hours saved.
```

**LinkedIn:**
```
The #1 mistake agents make with contracts:

Reading every page, every time.

Here's a better approach:

1. Scan for red flags (contingencies, deadlines, unusual terms)
2. Use AI to surface key dates and amounts
3. Focus your expertise on negotiation, not admin

Smart agents work smarter, not harder.
