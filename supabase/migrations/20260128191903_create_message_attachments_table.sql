-- Migration: Create message_attachments table
-- Part of Phase 2 Architecture Revamp - Sprint 2.1.4
-- NOTE: This migration is a placeholder. The real-time messaging feature
-- (conversations, messages, conversation_participants tables) is not yet implemented.
-- This migration will be updated when the messaging feature is built.

-- Skip this migration - prerequisites (messages, conversation_participants tables) don't exist yet
-- The message_attachments table will be created as part of the messaging feature implementation
