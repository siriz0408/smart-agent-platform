## Next Steps

### Immediate (Cycle 11 Planning)

1. **Execute DIS-015 test plan** - Now unblocked
2. **Implement MCP connector Phase 1** - Design complete
3. **Polish in-progress features** - 4 features at 85-95%
4. **Unblock PM-Growth** - Build metrics infrastructure
5. **Continue memory-based planning** - System validated

### Strategic

- ✅ Enhanced PM system validated - Keep using memory, performance tracking, cross-PM awareness
- ✅ Search fixes complete - Monitor success rate in production
- ✅ MCP connector architecture ready - Begin Phase 1 implementation
- ✅ 8 features ready for UI testing - Begin user testing

## Lessons Learned (Cycle 10)

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Memory system** - PMs referenced past learnings effectively
2. **Pre-work validation** - Vision scoring caught misaligned tasks early
3. **Cross-PM coordination** - PM-Discovery + PM-Infrastructure handoff perfect
4. **Enhanced reporting** - New format provides excellent visibility
5. **Performance tracking** - Easy to identify top performers

### What Could Improve 🟡

1. **Migration timing** - Should deploy migrations at start of cycle, not during
2. **Cross-PM dependencies** - Need better upfront coordination
3. **Token usage** - Orchestrator consumed significant tokens for reporting

### Recommendations for Cycle 11

1. Deploy migrations FIRST (if any pending)
2. Identify cross-PM dependencies in morning standup
3. Consider lighter reporting format to conserve tokens
4. Continue using memory system - very effective

## Post-Cycle Phase Complete ✅

**Status:** All system files updated and synchronized
**Quality:** High - All data accurate and complete
**Impact:** System ready for Cycle 11 planning

**Next Action:** Plan Cycle 11 priorities
