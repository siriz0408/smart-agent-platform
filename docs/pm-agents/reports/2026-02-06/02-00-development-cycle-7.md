## Executive Summary

Landmark cycle: **ZERO critical security items remain.** HO-006 (JWT verification) was the last critical handoff and is now resolved — all 33 user-facing edge functions have JWT verification enabled. Major feature additions include the AgentDetail page, Bridge Interactive MLS connector, growth metrics dashboard, search ranking overhaul, and granular notification preferences. E2E coverage expanded to 8 critical flows with 60+ new test cases this cycle alone.
