Let me check for any additional files that might contain prompts:

Now let me run the linter to check for any formatting issues:
The linter found some issues, but they're all in other files, not in the documentation file I created. The error in the playwright-mcp file is unrelated to my work. My documentation file doesn't have any linting issues.

Now let me commit the changes:
Now let me log my work:
Perfect! I have successfully completed task
