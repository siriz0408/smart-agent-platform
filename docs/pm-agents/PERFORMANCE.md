## Performance Metrics Framework

### Metrics Tracked

| Metric | Definition | Target | How Measured |
|--------|------------|--------|--------------|
| **Completion Rate** | % of tasks completed vs attempted | >85% | Completed tasks / Total tasks |
| **Quality Score** | % passing QA gate | >95% | QA Gate PASS / Total cycles |
| **Velocity** | Commits/files changed per cycle | Varies | Git commits, file changes |
| **Vision Alignment** | Average alignment scores | >7/10 | Vision scoring per task |
| **API Costs** | Estimated vs actual costs | <$400 per cycle | Cost estimates in reports |
| **Method Selection** | Appropriate use of /feature-dev vs brainstorming | Balanced | Track method choices |
| **Blocked Time** | How often PMs get blocked | <10% | Blocked tasks / Total tasks |
| **Bug Rate** | Issues found post-completion | <5% | Bugs found / Features shipped |
