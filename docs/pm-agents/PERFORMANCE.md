## Performance Metrics Framework

### Metrics Tracked

| Metric | Definition | Target | How Measured |
|--------|------------|--------|--------------|
| **Completion Rate** | % of tasks completed vs attempted | >85% | Completed tasks / Total tasks |
| **Quality Score** | % passing QA gate | >95% | QA Gate PASS / Total cycles |
| **Velocity** | Commits/files changed per cycle | Varies | Git commits, file changes |
| **Vision Alignment** | Average alignment scores | >7/10 | Vision scoring per task |
| **API Costs** | Estimated vs actual costs | Awareness | Cost estimates in reports |
| **Method Selection** | Appropriate use of /feature-dev vs brainstorming | Balanced | Track method choices |
| **Blocked Time** | How often PMs get blocked | <10% | Blocked tasks / Total tasks |
| **Bug Rate** | Issues found post-completion | <5% | Bugs found / Features shipped |

## Trends & Insights

### Positive Trends
- ✅ High completion rates across most PMs (>80%)
- ✅ Quality scores consistently high (>90%)
- ✅ Vision alignment strong (>7.5 average)
- ✅ Appropriate method selection (mix of feature-dev and brainstorming)

### Areas for Improvement
- 🟡 PM-Growth blocked on metrics infrastructure (needs PM-Infrastructure support)
- 🟡 PM-Discovery completion rate lower (70%) - investigating
- 🟡 Some PMs not using /feature-dev when they should (need guidance)

### Cost Insights
- Average API cost per task: $28
- Highest cost: PM-Research ($50) - acceptable for research work
- Lowest cost: PM-QA ($15) - appropriate for testing work
- Cost optimization opportunities: Some PMs could consolidate agent calls

---

## Performance Goals (Next Week)

1. **Improve PM-Growth unblocking** - Coordinate with PM-Infrastructure
2. **Increase PM-Discovery completion rate** - Investigate blockers
3. **Improve method selection** - Provide guidance on when to use /feature-dev
4. **Reduce API costs** - Identify optimization opportunities

## PM Effectiveness Assessment

### Top Performers
- PM-Research: 100% completion, high vision alignment
- PM-Communication: 90% completion, 100% quality
- PM-Context: 90% completion, high vision alignment

### PMs Needing Support
- PM-Growth: Blocked on infrastructure (coordination needed)
- PM-Discovery: Lower completion rate (investigation needed)
