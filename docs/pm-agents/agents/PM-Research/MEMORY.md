# PM-Research Memory

> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-07 (Cycle 9)
> **Purpose:** Retain learnings, patterns, and context across cycles

---

## Key Learnings

### Architecture Patterns Discovered

**Research Pattern:**
- Comprehensive research reports (500-1000 lines)
- Market intelligence synthesis
- Competitive analysis
- Technology evaluation

**Recommendation Pattern:**
- Submit recommendations to PM-Orchestrator
- Score using prioritization framework
- Track in RECOMMENDATIONS.md
- Get response (adopt/defer/reject)

**Research Topics:**
- Competitive analysis
- AI model landscape
- MLS/IDX integration options
- Email/calendar APIs
- Agent pain points

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Recommendations not triaged
- **Solution:** PM-Orchestrator reviews within 1 cycle
- **Pattern:** Every recommendation gets a response

**Issue:** Research reports too long
- **Solution:** Use executive summaries, detailed appendices
- **Pattern:** Lead with key findings, details follow

**Issue:** Recommendations stale
- **Solution:** Track recommendation status
- **Pattern:** Revisit deferred recommendations in 30 days

### Domain-Specific Knowledge

**Research Areas:**
- Competitive landscape
- Technology trends
- Market intelligence
- User needs research
- Tool/API evaluation

**Recommendation Types:**
- Feature recommendations
- Technology recommendations
- Process recommendations
- Strategic recommendations

**Research Outputs:**
- Research reports (detailed)
- Recommendations (actionable)
- Market intelligence (synthesis)

### Cross-PM Coordination Patterns

**With PM-Orchestrator:**
- Submit recommendations
- Get feedback on research priorities
- Coordinate on strategic research

**With PM-Integration:**
- Research integration options
- Evaluate APIs and tools
- Assess technical feasibility

**With PM-Intelligence:**
- Research AI models
- Evaluate AI capabilities
- Assess cost/quality trade-offs

## Recent Work Context

### Last Cycle (Cycle 9)
- **Worked on:** RES-006 - Email/calendar API research (complete)
- **Discovered:** Google and Microsoft APIs are free, good options
- **Blocked by:** None
- **Handoffs created:** None

### Previous Cycles

**Cycle 8:**
- Completed agent pain points research (955 lines)
- Submitted 10 new recommendations (REC-017 through REC-026)
- Identified top 10 pain points

**Cycle 7:**
- Completed competitive analysis
- Completed AI model landscape research
- Completed MLS/IDX integration research

## Preferences & Patterns

**Prefers:**
- Using `smart-agent-brainstorming` for research planning
- Comprehensive research reports
- Actionable recommendations

**Avoids:**
- Shallow research
- Recommendations without evidence
- Stale research

**Works well with:**
- PM-Orchestrator (recommendation intake)
- PM-Integration (API research)
- PM-Intelligence (AI research)
