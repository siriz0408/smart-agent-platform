## Task Details

### DIS-017: Search analytics dashboard ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority:** P2 | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Backlog DIS-013 evolution | **Completed:** 2026-02-15

**Problem:** Admins need visibility into search performance to monitor North Star metric (>95% success rate) and identify areas for improvement.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **New Hook: `useSearchClickStats`**
   - Fetches click-through statistics from `get_search_click_through_stats` RPC
   - TypeScript interfaces for type-safe data handling
   - Caching with 5-minute stale time

2. **New Component: `SearchAnalyticsDashboard`**
   - Three-tab layout: Overview, Click Analysis, Popular Queries
   - Time-based filtering: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days
   - North Star alert when success rate drops below 95%

3. **Overview Tab:**
   - Search Success Rate card with target indicator (>95%)
   - Total Searches with zero-result count
   - Average Latency with P95/P99 metrics and target (<500ms)
   - Average Results per search
   - Latency performance progress bar
   - Entity type distribution with success rates

4. **Click Analysis Tab:**
   - Total Clicks and unique queries
   - Average Click Position (lower is better)
   - Top 3 Clicks percentage
   - Click-Through Rate calculation
   - Clicks by entity type breakdown
   - Top clicked queries list

5. **Popular Queries Tab:**
   - Popular successful searches with frequency and success rate
   - Zero-result queries highlighted for content gap analysis
   - Query length distribution analysis

6. **Settings Integration:**
   - Added "Search" tab in Settings (admin only)
   - Follows existing admin tab pattern (Growth tab)

**Files Created:**
- `src/hooks/useSearchClickStats.ts` - Hook for CTR stats
- `src/components/search-analytics/SearchAnalyticsDashboard.tsx` - Dashboard component
- `src/components/search-analytics/index.ts` - Export barrel

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx` - Added Search Analytics tab

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Dashboard component created
- [x] Popular searches displayed
- [x] CTR rates shown
- [x] Zero-result queries highlighted
- [x] Time-based filtering (7d, 30d, 90d)
- [x] Search success rate trends visible
- [x] Admin-only access
- [x] Lint and TypeScript checks pass

### DIS-014: 🚨 CRITICAL - Fix global search numeric query failure ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority:** P0 | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Issue Tracker 2026-02-07 | **Completed:** 2026-02-07

**Problem:** User reports searching "922" (numeric query) returns "no results found". This is a critical search failure.

**Root Cause (IDENTIFIED):**
PostgreSQL's `websearch_to_tsquery('english', p_query)` filters out pure numeric queries because English text search considers numbers as non-searchable stop words. The ILIKE fallback existed BUT was combined with AND logic: both full-text search AND ILIKE had to pass, so numeric queries failed the full-text check and never reached ILIKE.

**Files Investigated:**
- ❌ Frontend components - Not the issue
- ❌ Query expansion (DIS-010) - Not the issue
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20260207000000_improve_search_ranking.sql` - **ROOT CAUSE HERE**

**The Fix (Migration: 20260207080000_fix_numeric_search.sql):**

1. **Numeric Query Detection:**
   - Added `v_is_numeric_query` boolean flag
   - Regex pattern: `^\s*\d+[\s\-]*\d*\s*$` (detects "922", "922 Main", "922-5555")

2. **Conditional Routing:**
   - **Numeric queries** → Skip `websearch_to_tsquery`, use ILIKE-only path
   - **Text queries** → Use `websearch_to_tsquery` OR ILIKE (changed AND to OR)

3. **Ranking for Numeric Queries:**
   - Set `base_rank = 0` for numeric queries (since full-text doesn't apply)
   - Calculate rank using: `exact_boost * position_boost * field_weight`
   - Ensures numeric matches still rank appropriately

4. **Enhanced Field Coverage:**
   - **Contacts:** Added `phone` field to ILIKE search (critical for numeric queries)
   - **Properties:** Added `zip_code` field to ILIKE search (critical for numeric queries)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- ✅ Text queries still use full-text search (no performance regression)
- ✅ Fuzzy matching unchanged
- ✅ Ranking algorithm intact for text queries
- ✅ Only adds new path for numeric queries

**Test Plan (For DIS-015):**
- [ ] Test "922" → Should return documents/contacts/properties with "922"
- [ ] Test "123 Main St" → Should work (alphanumeric)
- [ ] Test "555-1234" → Should match phone numbers
- [ ] Test "12345" → Should match zip codes
- [ ] Test "John" → Text queries still work
- [ ] Test "john smith" → Multi-word text queries still work
- [ ] Test typo "johhn" → Fuzzy matching still works

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Root cause identified (websearch_to_tsquery filters numbers)
- [x] Fix implemented (numeric query detection + ILIKE-only routing)
- [x] Migration created (20260207080000_fix_numeric_search.sql)
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [x] Enhanced coverage (phone, zip_code fields)
- [ ] Migration deployed to Supabase (PENDING)
- [ ] Manual testing completed (DIS-015)
- [ ] E2E tests updated (PENDING)

### DIS-015: Test all search types comprehensively
**Priority:** P0 | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Issue Tracker 2026-02-07

**Objective:** Run comprehensive test suite across all entity types to identify scope of search failures.

**Search Types to Test:**
1. **Documents** - Test: file names, content, metadata
2. **Contacts** - Test: names, emails, phone numbers, addresses
3. **Properties** - Test: addresses, property IDs, zip codes
4. **Deals** - Test: deal names, amounts, stages
5. **Agents** - Test: agent names, capabilities

**Test Matrix:**
| Query Type | Documents | Contacts | Properties | Deals | Agents |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|-------|--------|
| Numeric | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |
| Alphanumeric | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |
| Email | N/A | ❓ | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Phone | N/A | ❓ | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Address | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | N/A | N/A |

**Task:**
1. Create test queries for each entity type
2. Execute searches manually or via E2E tests
3. Document which work and which fail
4. Identify patterns (e.g., all numeric queries fail)
5. Report findings

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All 5 entity types tested
- [ ] Test matrix filled out
- [ ] Failures documented
- [ ] Root causes identified
- [ ] Report created

### DIS-016: Fix search input matching discrepancy
**Priority:** P0 | **Effort:** S | **Source:** Issue Tracker 2026-02-07

**Problem:** "Search doesn't match what I input in the input message bar" - user confusion about what's being searched.

**Files to Investigate:**
- `src/components/search/GlobalSearch.tsx`
- `src/components/search/SearchResultsDropdown.tsx`
- Query transformation logic

**Task:**
1. Verify search input UI shows what user types
2. Check if query is being transformed before execution
3. Add debug logging to show: user input → transformed query
4. Ensure UI reflects actual search query
5. If transformation is necessary, show it to user

**Possible Issues:**
- Query expansion modifying input without user knowledge
- Typo correction changing query silently
- Synonym expansion not visible to user

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Search input matches query execution
- [ ] If query is transformed, user sees it
- [ ] Clear visual feedback on what's being searched
- [ ] Tests pass
