## Processing Instructions for PM-Orchestrator

**Before each cycle:**
1. Read this file
2. **Analyze Images:** For each section with images:
   - Images are numbered sequentially per section (Image 1, Image 2, Image 3, etc.)
   - Cross-reference image numbers mentioned in text (e.g., "See Image 1" = first image in that section)
   - **Bug reports:** Analyze screenshots to diagnose issues - look for:
     * Error messages, console logs, network errors
     * UI elements that are broken or misaligned
     * Visual regressions or styling issues
     * Steps to reproduce visible in screenshots
   - **Feature requests:** Review mockups/wireframes to understand:
     * Desired UI/UX patterns
     * User workflows and interactions
     * Design specifications
   - **Testing feedback:** Examine screenshots to:
     * Verify test results and outcomes
     * Identify visual issues or bugs
     * Understand user workflows and edge cases
3. Process each section:
   - Strategic feedback → Update VISION.md or priorities (consider any attached diagrams/charts)
   - Bug reports → Route to appropriate PM (add to their BACKLOG.md), include image references in bug description
   - Task delegation → Add to PM backlogs, reference images if provided
   - Research assignments → Assign to PM-Research (add to their BACKLOG.md), include image context
   - Feature requests → Score and route using prioritization framework, analyze mockups/images
   - Decision responses → Update DECISIONS.md, consider any attached context images
   - Testing feedback → Route to PM-QA and relevant domain PMs, analyze screenshots for issues/improvements
4. After processing, clear this file (keep only this header)
5. Update roadmap HTML: Clear submitted feedback section
